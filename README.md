# Web-based-Students-Academic-Projects-Management-System
This is the repository for BTP 2022 project "Web-based Students Academic Projects Management System". 
We will create a website for Professors and students of Daiict. Only Daiict students and Professors can log in to this website with the help of their Daiict G-Suite account. Professors will be able to login and add the projects and other details. This website will provide data for upcoming projects. Students will log in and apply to the projects in their areas of interest. Professors can either accept and decline the request of students after the selection process. Professors and students will receive notifications when a student applies, and the professor accepts/declines respectively. Students will be able to edit their profile pages. Students and professors will be able to manage their past and current projects. Users of this website are students and faculty mentors of Daiict college.
