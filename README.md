# Web-based-Students-Academic-Projects-Management-System
We will create a website for Professors and students of DAIICT. Only Daiict students and Professors can log in to this website with the help of their Daiict G-Suite account. Professors will be able to log in and make changes (create or withdraw) to the projects and other details within Time Limit. This website will provide data for upcoming projects. Students will log in and apply (as a team or individuals) to the projects in their areas of interest. Professors can either accept or decline the request of students after the selection process. Professors will receive notifications when a student applies, When someone withdraws the application, and When someone takes on another project. Every team member or student will receive notifications when the professor accepts/declines, a student adds you as a team member, or while applying and scheduling a meeting. Users will be able to edit their profile pages. Users also see their timetables. Professors also Add project status, minutes of meetings, and marks of every meeting. Students see all the information added by a professor.  Students and professors will be able to manage their past and current projects. Users of this website are students and faculty mentors of DAIICT college.
